# oci-mapr
This is a Terraform template for deploying a fully configured MapR cluster on OCI. 

## N-Node
This is an N-Node template allowing for dynamic number of Data Nodes to be deployed with MapR.

## How to use this template
In addition to an active tenancy on OCI, you will need a functional installation of Terraform, and an API key for a privileged user in the tenancy.  See these documentation links for more information:

* [Getting Started with Terraform on OCI](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformgetstarted.htm)
* [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How)

Once the pre-requisites are in place, you will need to copy the template from this repository to where you have Terraform installed.  Refer to the README.md for the template for additional deployment instructions.
